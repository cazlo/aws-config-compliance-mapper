## dynamodb-throughput-limit-check

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/dynamodb-throughput-limit-check.html)


### Guidance

Enable this rule to ensure that provisioned throughput capacity is checked on your Amazon DynamoDB tables. This is the amount of read/write activity that each table can support. DynamoDB uses this information to reserve sufficient system resources to meet your throughput requirements. This rule generates an alert when the throughput approaches the maximum limit for a customer's account. This rule allows you to optionally set accountRCUThresholdPercentage (Config Default: 80) and accountWCUThresholdPercentage (Config Default: 80) parameters. The actual values should reflect your organization's policies.

- [FedRAMP Moderate - SI-3](https://csf.tools/reference/nist-sp-800-53/r5/si/si-3/) (The organization: a. Employs malicious code protection mechanisms at information system entry and exit points to detect and eradicate malicious code; b. Updates malicious code protection mechanisms whenever new releases are available in accordance with organizational configuration management policy and procedures; c. Configures malicious code protection mechanisms to: 1. Perform periodic scans of the information system [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] and real-time scans of files from external sources at [Selection(one or more); endpoint; network entry/exit points] as the files are downloaded, opened, or executed in accordance with organizational security policy; and 2. [Selection(one or more): block malicious code; quarantine malicious code; send alert to administrator; [Assignment: organization-defined action]] in response to malicious code detection; and d. Addresses the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the information system. Supplemental Guidance: Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers, workstations, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats(for example, UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography. Malicious code can be transported by different means including, for example, web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including, for example, secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads, and/or actions in response to detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.

Supplemental Guidance: Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in non- executable regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited. Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism. Related controls: AC-25, SC-3. Control Enhancements: None. References: None.)

## vpc-vpn-2-tunnels-up

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/vpc-vpn-2-tunnels-up.html)


### Guidance

Redundant Site-to-Site VPN tunnels can be implemented to achieve resilience requirements. It uses two tunnels to help ensure connectivity in case one of the Site-to-Site VPN connections becomes unavailable. To protect against a loss of connectivity, in case your customer gateway becomes unavailable, you can set up a second Site-to-Site VPN connection to your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and virtual private gateway by using a second customer gateway.

## redshift-enhanced-vpc-routing-enabled

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/redshift-enhanced-vpc-routing-enabled.html)


### Guidance

Enhanced VPC routing forces all COPY and UNLOAD traffic between the cluster and data repositories to go through your Amazon VPC. You can then use VPC features such as security groups and network access control lists to secure network traffic. You can also use VPC flow logs to monitor network traffic.

## ec2-instances-in-vpc

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-instances-in-vpc.html)


### Guidance

Deploy Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to enable secure communication between an instance and other services within the amazon VPC, without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection. All traffic remains securely within the AWS Cloud. Because of their logical isolation, domains that reside within an Amazon VPC have an extra layer of security when compared to domains that use public endpoints. Assign Amazon EC2 instances to an Amazon VPC to properly manage access.

The alarm performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric or expression relative to a threshold over a number of time periods. This rule requires a value for alarmActionRequired (Config Default: True), insufficientDataActionRequired (Config Default: True), okActionRequired (Config Default: False). The actual value should reflect the alarm actions for your environment.

### Guidance

AWS CloudTrail can help in non-repudiation by recording AWS Management Console actions and API calls. You can identify the users and AWS accounts that called an AWS service, the source IP address where the calls generated, and the timings of the calls. Details of captured data are seen within AWS CloudTrail Record Contents.

### Applicable Security Controls

- [AWS Well Architected Reliability Pillar - REL-6](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/welcome.html) (How do you monitor workload resources? Logs and metrics are powerful tools to gain insight into the health of your workload. You can configure your workload to monitor logs and metrics and send notifications when thresholds are crossed or significant events occur. Monitoring enables your workload to recognize when low-performance thresholds are crossed or failures occur, so it can recover automatically in response.)

## multi-region-cloudtrail-enabled

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/multi-region-cloudtrail-enabled.html)


### Guidance

AWS CloudTrail records AWS Management Console actions and API calls. You can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address from where the calls were made, and when the calls occurred. CloudTrail will deliver log files from all AWS Regions to your S3 bucket if MULTI_REGION_CLOUD_TRAIL_ENABLED is enabled. Additionally, when AWS launches a new Region, CloudTrail will create the same trail in the new Region. As a result, you will receive log files containing API activity for the new Region without taking any action.

### Guidance

Amazon GuardDuty can help to monitor and detect potential cybersecurity events by using threat intelligence feeds. These include lists of malicious IPs and machine learning to identify unexpected, unauthorized, and malicious activity within your AWS Cloud environment.

### Applicable Security Controls

- [AWS Well Architected Reliability Pillar - REL-6](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/welcome.html) (How do you monitor workload resources? Logs and metrics are powerful tools to gain insight into the health of your workload. You can configure your workload to monitor logs and metrics and send notifications when thresholds are crossed or significant events occur. Monitoring enables your workload to recognize when low-performance thresholds are crossed or failures occur, so it can recover automatically in response.)

### Guidance

AWS Security Hub helps to monitor unauthorized personnel, connections, devices, and software. AWS Security Hub aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes the security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS services. Some such services are Amazon Security Hub, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer, and AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Partner solutions.

### Applicable Security Controls

- [AWS Well Architected Reliability Pillar - REL-6](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/welcome.html) (How do you monitor workload resources? Logs and metrics are powerful tools to gain insight into the health of your workload. You can configure your workload to monitor logs and metrics and send notifications when thresholds are crossed or significant events occur. Monitoring enables your workload to recognize when low-performance thresholds are crossed or failures occur, so it can recover automatically in response.)

### Guidance

This rule ensures that Amazon Redshift clusters have the preferred settings for your organization. Specifically, that they have preferred maintenance windows and automated snapshot retention periods for the database. This rule requires you to set the allowVersionUpgrade. The default is true. It also lets you optionally set the preferredMaintenanceWindow (the default is sat:16:00-sat:16:30), and the automatedSnapshotRetentionPeriod (the default is 1). The actual values should reflect your organization's policies.

### Guidance

Use AWS Systems Manager Associations to help with inventory of software platforms and applications within an organization. AWS Systems Manager assigns a configuration state to your managed instances and allows you to set baselines of operating system patch levels, software installations, application configurations, and other details about your environment.

### Applicable Security Controls

- [AWS Well Architected Reliability Pillar - REL-8](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/welcome.html) (How do you implement change? Controlled changes are necessary to deploy new functionality, and to ensure that the workloads and the operating environment are running known software and can be patched or replaced in a predictable manner. If these changes are uncontrolled, then it makes it difficult to predict the effect of these changes, or to address issues that arise because of them.)
- [AWS Well Architected Security Pillar - SEC-1](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html) (How do you securely operate your workload? To operate your workload securely, you must apply overarching best practices to every area of security. Take requirements and processes that you have defined in operational excellence at an organizational and workload level, and apply them to all areas. Staying up to date with AWS and industry recommendations and threat intelligence helps you evolve your threat model and control objectives. Automating security processes, testing, and validation allow you to scale your security operations.)
- [AWS Well Architected Security Pillar - SEC-6](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html) (How do you protect your compute resources?

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/elasticache-redis-cluster-automatic-backup-check.html)


### Guidance

When automatic backups are enabled, Amazon ElastiCache creates a backup of the cluster on a daily basis. The backup can be retained for a number of days as specified by your organization. Automatic backups can help guard against data loss. If a failure occurs, you can create a new cluster, which restores your data from the most recent backup.

### Guidance

To help with data back-up processes, ensure your Amazon Redshift clusters have automated snapshots. When automated snapshots are enabled for a cluster, Redshift periodically takes snapshots of that cluster. By default, Redshift takes a snapshot every eight hours or every 5 GB for each node of data changes, or whichever comes first.

## elb-cross-zone-load-balancing-enabled

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/elb-cross-zone-load-balancing-enabled.html)


### Guidance

Enable cross-zone load balancing for your Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) to help maintain adequate capacity and availability. The cross-zone load balancing reduces the need to maintain equivalent numbers of instances in each enabled availability zone. It also improves your application's ability to handle the loss of one or more instances.

## rds-multi-az-support

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/rds-multi-az-support.html)


### Guidance

Multi-AZ support in Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) provides enhanced availability and durability for database instances. When you provision a Multi-AZ database instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary database instance, and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone. Each Availability Zone runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete.

## mfa-enabled-for-iam-console-access

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/mfa-enabled-for-iam-console-access.html)


### Guidance

Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring that MFA is enabled for all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users that have a console password. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of sign-in credentials. By requiring MFA for users, you can reduce incidents of compromised accounts and keep sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorized users.

Understanding the type of identity you need to manage and grant access helps you ensure the right identities have access to the right resources under the right conditions. Human Identities: Your administrators, developers, operators, and end users require an identity to access your AWS environments and applications. These are members of your organization, or external users with whom you collaborate, and who interact with your AWS resources from a web browser, client application, or interactive command-line tools. Machine Identities: Your service applications, operational tools, and workloads require an identity to make requests to AWS services - for example, to read data. These identities include machines running in your AWS environment such as Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions. You might also manage machine identities for external parties who need access. Additionally, you may also have machines outside of AWS that need access to your AWS environment.)

## iam-user-mfa-enabled

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-user-mfa-enabled.html)


### Guidance

Enable this rule to restrict access to resources in the AWS Cloud. This rule ensures multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all users. MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of sign-in credentials. Reduce the incidents of compromised accounts by requiring MFA for users.

To operate your workload securely, you must apply overarching best practices to every area of security. Take requirements and processes that you have defined in operational excellence at an organizational and workload level, and apply them to all areas. Staying up to date with AWS and industry recommendations and threat intelligence helps you evolve your threat model and control objectives.

There are two types of identities you need to manage when approaching operating secure AWS workloads. Understanding the type of identity you need to manage and grant access helps you ensure the right identities have access to the right resources under the right conditions. Human Identities: Your administrators, developers, operators, and end users require an identity to access your AWS environments and applications. These are members of your organization, or external users with whom you collaborate, and who interact with your AWS resources from a web browser, client application, or interactive command-line tools. Machine Identities: Your service applications, operational tools, and workloads require an identity to make requests to AWS services - for example, to read data. These identities include machines running in your AWS environment such as Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions. You might also manage machine identities for external parties who need access. Additionally, you may also have machines outside of AWS that need access to your AWS environment.)

## iam-root-access-key-check

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-root-access-key-check.html)


### Guidance

Access to systems and assets can be controlled by checking that the root user does not have access keys attached to their AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. Ensure that the root access keys are deleted. Instead, create and use role-based AWS accounts to help to incorporate the principle of least functionality.

## root-account-hardware-mfa-enabled

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/root-account-hardware-mfa-enabled.html)


### Guidance

Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring hardware MFA is enabled for the root user. The root user is the most privileged user in an AWS account. The MFA adds an extra layer of protection for sign-in credentials. By requiring MFA for the root user, you can reduce the incidents of compromised AWS accounts.

Understanding the type of identity you need to manage and grant access helps you ensure the right identities have access to the right resources under the right conditions. Human Identities: Your administrators, developers, operators, and end users require an identity to access your AWS environments and applications. These are members of your organization, or external users with whom you collaborate, and who interact with your AWS resources from a web browser, client application, or interactive command-line tools. Machine Identities: Your service applications, operational tools, and workloads require an identity to make requests to AWS services - for example, to read data. These identities include machines running in your AWS environment such as Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions. You might also manage machine identities for external parties who need access. Additionally, you may also have machines outside of AWS that need access to your AWS environment.)

### Guidance

Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring MFA is enabled for the root user. The root user is the most privileged user in an AWS account. The MFA adds an extra layer of protection for sign-in credentials. By requiring MFA for the root user, you can reduce the incidents of compromised AWS accounts.

## iam-password-policy

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-password-policy.html)


### Guidance

The identities and the credentials are issued, managed, and verified based on an organizational IAM password policy. They meet or exceed requirements as stated by NIST SP 800-63 and the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices standard for password strength. This rule allows you to optionally set RequireUppercaseCharacters (AWS Foundational Security Best Practices value: true), RequireLowercaseCharacters (AWS Foundational Security Best Practices value: true), RequireSymbols (AWS Foundational Security Best Practices value: true), RequireNumbers (AWS Foundational Security Best Practices value: true), MinimumPasswordLength (AWS Foundational Security Best Practices value: 14), PasswordReusePrevention (AWS Foundational Security Best Practices value: 24), and MaxPasswordAge (AWS Foundational Security Best Practices value: 90) for your IAM Password Policy. The actual values should reflect your organization's policies.

### Applicable Security Controls

Machine Identities: Your service applications, operational tools, and workloads require an identity to make requests to AWS services - for example, to read data. These identities include machines running in your AWS environment such as Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions. You might also manage machine identities for external parties who need access.

### Guidance

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) can help you incorporate the principles of least privilege and separation of duties with access permissions and authorizations, by ensuring that IAM groups have at least one user. Placing users in groups based on their associated permissions or job function is one way to incorporate least privilege.

## iam-no-inline-policy-check

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-no-inline-policy-check.html)


### Guidance

Ensure an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user, IAM role or IAM group does not have an inline policy to control access to systems and assets. AWS recommends to use managed policies instead of inline policies. The managed policies allow reusability, versioning and rolling back, and delegating permissions management.

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) can help you incorporate the principles of least privilege and separation of duties with access permissions and authorizations, restricting policies from containing "Effect": "Allow" with "Action": "*" over "Resource": "*". Allowing users to have more privileges than needed to complete a task may violate the principle of least privilege and separation of duties.

### Guidance

Ensure IAM Actions are restricted to only those actions that are needed. Allowing users to have more privileges than needed to complete a task may violate the principle of least privilege and separation of duties.

There are two types of identities you need to manage when approaching operating secure AWS workloads. Understanding the type of identity you need to manage and grant access helps you ensure the right identities have access to the right resources under the right conditions. Human Identities: Your administrators, developers, operators, and end users require an identity to access your AWS environments and applications. These are members of your organization, or external users with whom you collaborate, and who interact with your AWS resources from a web browser, client application, or interactive command-line tools. Machine Identities: Your service applications, operational tools, and workloads require an identity to make requests to AWS services - for example, to read data. These identities include machines running in your AWS environment such as Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions. You might also manage machine identities for external parties who need access. Additionally, you may also have machines outside of AWS that need access to your AWS environment.)

## iam-user-unused-credentials-check

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-user-unused-credentials-check.html)


### Guidance

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) can help you with access permissions and authorizations by checking for IAM passwords and access keys that are not used for a specified time period. If these unused credentials are identified, you should disable and/or remove the credentials, as this may violate the principle of least privilege. This rule requires you to set a value to the maxCredentialUsageAge (Config Default: 90). The actual value should reflect your organization's policies.

### Applicable Security Controls

There are two types of identities you need to manage when approaching operating secure AWS workloads. Understanding the type of identity you need to manage and grant access helps you ensure the right identities have access to the right resources under the right conditions. Human Identities: Your administrators, developers, operators, and end users require an identity to access your AWS environments and applications. These are members of your organization, or external users with whom you collaborate, and who interact with your AWS resources from a web browser, client application, or interactive command-line tools. Machine Identities: Your service applications, operational tools, and workloads require an identity to make requests to AWS services - for example, to read data. These identities include machines running in your AWS environment such as Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions. You might also manage machine identities for external parties who need access. Additionally, you may also have machines outside of AWS that need access to your AWS environment.)

## access-keys-rotated

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/access-keys-rotated.html)


### Guidance

The credentials are audited for authorized devices, users, and processes by ensuring IAM access keys are rotated as specified by the organizational policy. Changing the access keys on a regular schedule is a security best practice. It shortens the period an access key is active and reduces the business impact if the keys are compromised. This rule requires an access key rotation value (Config Default: 90). The actual value should reflect your organization's policies.

## ecs-containers-nonprivileged

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ecs-containers-nonprivileged.html)


### Guidance

To assist with implementing the principle of least privilege, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task definitions should not have elevated privilege enabled. When this parameter is true, the container is given elevated privileges on the host container instance (similar to the root user).

### Applicable Security Controls

## ecs-containers-readonly-access

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ecs-containers-readonly-access.html)


### Guidance

Enabling read only access to Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) containers can assist in adhering to the principal of least privilege. This option can reduces attack vectors as the container instance’s filesystem cannot be modified unless it has explicit read-write permissions.

## efs-access-point-enforce-user-identity

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/efs-access-point-enforce-user-identity.html)


### Guidance

To assist with implementing the principle of least privilege, ensure user enforcement is enabled for your Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) .When enabled, Amazon EFS replaces the NFS client's user and group IDs with the identity configured on the access point for all file system operations and only grants access to this enforced user identity.

## emr-kerberos-enabled

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/emr-kerberos-enabled.html)


### Guidance

The access permissions and authorizations can be managed and incorporated with the principles of least privilege and separation of duties, by enabling Kerberos for Amazon EMR clusters. In Kerberos, the services and the users that need to authenticate are known as principals. The principals exist within a Kerberos realm. Within the realm, a Kerberos server is known as the key distribution center (KDC). It provides a means for the principals to authenticate. The KDC authenticates by issuing tickets for authentication. The KDC maintains a database of the principals within its realm, their passwords, and other administrative information about each principal.

## iam-customer-policy-blocked-kms-actions

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-customer-policy-blocked-kms-actions.html)


### Guidance

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) can help you incorporate the principles of least privilege and separation of duties with access permissions and authorizations, restricting policies from containing blocked actions on all AWS Key Management Service keys. Having more privileges than needed to complete a task may violate the principle of least privilege and separation of duties. This rule allows you to set the blockedActionsPatterns parameter. (AWS Foundational Security Best Practices value: kms:Decrypt, kms:ReEncryptFrom). The actual values should reflect your organization's policies

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/opensearch-in-vpc-only.html)


### Guidance

Manage access to the AWS Cloud by ensuring Amazon OpenSearch Service domains are within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). An Amazon OpenSearch Service domain within an Amazon VPC enables secure communication between Amazon OpenSearch Service and other services within the Amazon VPC without the need for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection.

## lambda-inside-vpc

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/lambda-inside-vpc.html)


### Guidance

Deploy AWS Lambda functions within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) for a secure communication between a function and other services within the Amazon VPC. With this configuration, there is no requirement for an internet gateway, NAT device, or VPN connection. All the traffic remains securely within the AWS Cloud. Because of their logical isolation, domains that reside within an Amazon VPC have an extra layer of security when compared to domains that use public endpoints. To properly manage access, AWS Lambda functions should be assigned to a VPC.

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/s3-account-level-public-access-blocks-periodic.html)


### Guidance

Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring that Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets cannot be publicly accessed. This rule helps keeping sensitive data safe from unauthorized remote users by preventing public access. This rule allows you to optionally set the ignorePublicAcls (Config Default: True), blockPublicPolicy (Config Default: True), blockPublicAcls (Config Default: True), and restrictPublicBuckets parameters (Config Default: True). The actual values should reflect your organization's policies.

### Guidance

Manage access to the AWS Cloud by ensuring Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) subnets are not automatically assigned a public IP address. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances that are launched into subnets that have this attribute enabled have a public IP address assigned to their primary network interface.

## ec2-instance-multiple-eni-check

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-instance-multiple-eni-check.html)


### Guidance

This rule checks if your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances have multiple ENIs. Having multiple ENIs can cause dual-homed instances, meaning instances that have multiple subnets. This can add network security complexity and introduce unintended network paths and access.

### Applicable Security Controls

- [AWS Well Architected Security Pillar - SEC-5](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html) (How do you protect your network resources?

## restricted-common-ports

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/restricted-common-ports.html)


### Guidance

Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring common ports are restricted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) security groups. Not restricting access to ports to trusted sources can lead to attacks against the availability, integrity and confidentiality of systems. This rule allows you to optionally set blockedPort1 - blockedPort5 parameters (Config Defaults: 20,21,3389,3306,4333). The actual values should reflect your organization's policies.

### Guidance

Manage access to resources in the AWS Cloud by ensuring common ports are restricted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Security Groups. Not restricting access on ports to trusted sources can lead to attacks against the availability, integrity and confidentiality of systems. By restricting access to resources within a security group from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) remote access can be controlled to internal systems.

## cloud-trail-log-file-validation-enabled

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/cloud-trail-log-file-validation-enabled.html)


### Guidance

Utilize AWS CloudTrail log file validation to check the integrity of CloudTrail logs. Log file validation helps determine if a log file was modified or deleted or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered it. This feature is built using industry standard algorithms: SHA-256 for hashing and SHA-256 with RSA for digital signing. This makes it computationally infeasible to modify, delete or forge CloudTrail log files without detection.

## iam-inline-policy-blocked-kms-actions

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-inline-policy-blocked-kms-actions.html)


### Guidance

Ensure an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user, IAM role or IAM group does not have an inline policy to allow blocked actions on all AWS Key Management Service keys. AWS recommends to use managed policies instead of inline policies. The managed policies allow reusability, versioning, rolling back, and delegating permissions management. This rule allows you to set the blockedActionsPatterns parameter. (AWS Foundational Security Best Practices value: kms:Decrypt, kms:ReEncryptFrom). The actual values should reflect your organization's policies.

## alb-desync-mode-check

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/alb-desync-mode-check.html)


### Guidance

To assist in protecting applications for HTTP Desync vulnerabilities, ensure HTTP Desync mitigation mode is enabled on your application load balancers. HTTP Desync issues can lead to request smuggling and make your applications vulnerable to request queue or cache poisoning. Desync mitigation modes are monitor, defensive, and strictest. Defensive is the default mode.

### Applicable Security Controls

- [NIST 800-172 - 3.1.3e](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/172/final) (Employ [Assignment: organization-defined secure information transfer solutions] to control information flows between security domains on connected systems.)

## ec2-token-hop-limit-check

See also [AWS docs for rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/ec2-token-hop-limit-check.html)


### Guidance

Ensure the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) HTTP PUT response is restricted to the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. With IMDSv2, the PUT response that contains the secret token by default cannot travel outside the instance, because the Metadata response hop limit is set to 1 (Config default). If this value is greater than 1, the token is able to leave the EC2 instance.
